    <h1>Maggi</h1>
    <img src="images/maggi" alt="maggi">
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This is maggi, the most famous and delicious instant noodles that you can prepare with no additional ingredients at your home or wherever you want if you have access to a cooking bowl and water, and of course a stove.</p>
    <p>The image you're seeing may not look beautiful because it's the simplest and quickest way of making maggi. They say you can cook it in two minutes, but no, it atleast takes 4. If you want your maggi to look fancy, you can add whatever you want, but I know only this way, and I'm gonna tell you that.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Maggi</strong> (if you don't know what <em>Maggi</em> is and somehow got to this webpage, <em>Maggi</em> is ready-to-cook instant noodles, available in supermarkets and shops India, don't know if it's available somewhere else too. It comes in a yellow packets, looks like a Lays, but without air. It comes in various packet sizes, like six pack, 4 pack. Buy whichever you want, but remember, eating a six pack maggi won't give you six packs;)</li>
            <li><Strong>Water</Strong></li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Open the Maggi packet.</li>
            <li>There will be masala packets inside the packet, open the them too, only one masala packet if youre gonna cook only one Magggi. Don't eat more than one, it's not healthy.</li>
            <li>Put a cooking bowl on the stove.</li>
            <li>Turn on the stove.</li>
            <li>Put Maggi in the bowl.</li>
            <li>Pour some fresh water into the bowl, not much, just enough water so that half the tickness of the Maggi is inside the water.</li>
            <li>Add the Maggi masala into the water.</li>
            <li>Wait till the watr biols and the Maggi becomes soft.</li>
            <li>Mix the Maggi so that masala gets distributed to the <em>entirety of the Maggi.</em></li>
            <li>Forgot to say, use a spoon, not your finger. Oops, sorry if you've burned your finger.</li>
            <li>When the most of the water gets disappeared, start stirring <em>furiously</em> so that the Maggi won't stick to the bowl.</li>
            <li>Put off the stove once the water is almost disappeared. If you want it soupy, you should add a bit more water, no not now, at the beginning. Now you can't do anything, soupy Maggi doesn't taste good though.</li>
            <li>Oooh I forgot to say this too, but you most definitely will have a plate around you. Put the maggi in it. If you don't have a plate, eat from the bowl, but carefully, don't touch the hot bowl, it'll burn.</li>
            <li>And most importantly, don't take a picture for snapchat or instagram, you didn't win any noble prize, you just boiled some water with Maggi and masala in it. Just eat and enjoy it. <em>Andariki pampiste dhishti thagulthadi.</em></li>
        </ol>
    <p>If you want that fancy kind of Maggi like in the picture that's on the packet, ask your mom or sister to make it :)</p>
